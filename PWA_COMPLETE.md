- Run **Lighthouse** → **Progressive Web App** audit

### 2. On Your Mobile Device

#### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Transform app into Progressive Web App"
git push
```
Then open your Vercel URL on your phone!

#### Or Test Locally
Your app is running on your local network at:
```
http://172.20.10.2:3000

## 📊 Caching Strategy

Your app uses intelligent caching:

| Asset Type | Strategy | Duration |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| 3D Models (.fbx, .glb, .gltf) | Cache First | 30 days |
| Images | Stale While Revalidate | 24 hours |
| JavaScript/CSS | Stale While Revalidate | 24 hours |
| API Calls | Network First | 24 hours fallback |
| Fonts | Cache First | 365 days |

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Theme Colors
Edit `public/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "theme_color": "#3b82f6",      // Browser toolbar color
  "background_color": "#0f172a"   // Splash screen background
}
```

### Change App Name
Edit `public/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "Your App Name",
  "short_name": "ShortName"
}
```

### Modify Install Prompt
Edit `src/components/shared/InstallPWA.tsx` to customize:
- Timing (currently 3 seconds)
- Design/colors
- Dismiss duration (currently 7 days)

### Adjust Caching
Edit `next.config.ts` → `runtimeCaching` array to:
- Change cache durations
- Add/remove asset types
- Modify caching strategies

## 📱 Platform Support

| Feature | Android Chrome | iOS Safari | Desktop Chrome |
|---------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| Install Prompt | ✅ Auto | ⚠️ Manual | ✅ Auto |
| Service Worker | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full |
| Offline Support | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Background Sync | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Push Notifications | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Full Screen | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check Service Worker Status
```javascript
// In browser console
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(registrations => {
  console.log('Service Workers:', registrations);
});
```

### Check If Installed
```javascript
// In browser console
if (window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches) {
  console.log('App is installed!');
}
```

### View Cache Contents
1. Open DevTools
2. Go to **Application** → **Cache Storage**
3. Expand caches to see cached files

### Clear Everything (for testing)
```javascript
// In browser console
caches.keys().then(names => {
  names.forEach(name => caches.delete(name));
});
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add PWA support with offline capabilities and mobile optimization"
git push
```

Vercel automatically:
- ✅ Provides HTTPS (required for PWA)
- ✅ Serves manifest and service worker correctly
- ✅ Handles all static assets
- ✅ Enables proper caching headers

### Verify After Deployment
1. Open deployed URL on mobile
2. Check install prompt appears
3. Install and test offline mode
4. Run Lighthouse audit (aim for 90+ PWA score)

## 📈 Success Metrics

Your PWA is working correctly if:

1. ✅ **Lighthouse PWA Score**: 90+
2. ✅ **Performance Score**: 80+
3. ✅ **Service Worker**: Registered and active
4. ✅ **Manifest**: Valid with all required fields
5. ✅ **Offline**: Works without network
6. ✅ **Installable**: Can add to home screen
7. ✅ **Mobile Friendly**: Touch controls work smoothly

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Test Locally**: Open http://localhost:3000 and test all features
2. **Deploy**: Push to Vercel and test on real mobile devices
3. **Share**: Send the link to testers to try installation
4. **Monitor**: Check analytics for install rates and engagement
5. **Iterate**: Gather feedback and improve the experience

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always test on real devices** - Emulators don't fully support PWA features
2. **Use HTTPS** - Required for service workers (Vercel provides this)
3. **Update service worker** - Users get updates automatically on next visit
4. **Monitor cache size** - Keep total cache under 50MB for best performance
5. **Test offline early** - Catch caching issues before deployment

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "Service worker failed to register"
- Check if using HTTPS (required)
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors

### "Install prompt not showing"
- Wait 3+ seconds after page load
- Check if already installed
- Verify manifest.json is valid

### "Models not loading offline"
- Visit pages online first to cache
- Check cache size limits
- Verify service worker is registered

## 🎊 Congratulations!

Your app is now a modern Progressive Web App that:
- 📱 Works like a native mobile app
- ⚡ Loads instantly after first visit
- 🔌 Works offline
- 🎯 Can be installed on any device
- 🚀 Provides an amazing user experience
