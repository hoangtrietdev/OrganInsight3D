## 🗄️ Caching Strategy

The app uses intelligent caching strategies:

### Cache-First (Long-term storage)
- 3D Models (`.fbx`, `.glb`, `.gltf`) - 30 days
- Fonts - 365 days
- Audio/Video - 24 hours

### Stale-While-Revalidate (Show cache, update in background)
- Images - 24 hours
- CSS/JS - 24 hours
- Next.js data - 24 hours

### Network-First (Always try network first)
- API calls - 24 hours fallback
- JSON/XML data - 24 hours fallback

## 📊 Service Worker

The service worker is automatically generated by `next-pwa` and:
- Caches all static assets during installation
- Updates in the background when new versions are available
- Provides offline functionality
- Pre-caches critical resources

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Locally
```bash
# Build the production version (service worker only works in production)
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm start

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Test on Mobile Device
1. Deploy to Vercel (or your hosting service)
2. Open the URL on your mobile device
3. Test the install prompt
4. Install the app
5. Test offline functionality (turn off WiFi/data)

### Lighthouse PWA Audit
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Lighthouse** tab
3. Select **Progressive Web App**
4. Click **Generate report**
5. Aim for 90+ score!

## ✅ PWA Checklist

- ✅ Valid `manifest.json` with all required fields
- ✅ Service worker registered and active
- ✅ HTTPS (required - handled by Vercel)
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- ✅ Fast loading (< 3 seconds)
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Installable

## 📱 Platform-Specific Notes

### iOS Safari

- Full PWA support
- Install from address bar
- Window integration
- Keyboard shortcuts work

## 🚀 Performance Tips

1. **Preload Critical Assets**: The app preloads fonts and critical CSS
2. **Lazy Load 3D Models**: Models load on-demand with Suspense
3. **Image Optimization**: Use WebP format where possible
4. **Code Splitting**: Next.js automatically splits code
5. **Service Worker Caching**: Static assets cached for instant loading

## 🔒 Security

- HTTPS required (automatically provided by Vercel)
- Content Security Policy recommended for production
- Service worker scope limited to app directory
- No sensitive data stored in cache

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Install prompt doesn't appear
- Check if already installed
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Wait 3 seconds after page load
- Check console for errors

### Service worker not updating
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear site data in browser settings
- Unregister old service worker in DevTools → Application → Service Workers

### Models not loading offline
- Ensure models were cached (visit them while online first)
- Check cache storage in DevTools → Application → Cache Storage
- Verify cache size limits not exceeded

### iOS installation issues
- Must use Safari (Chrome/Firefox on iOS don't support PWA install)
- Check that website is running on HTTPS
- Ensure manifest.json is accessible

## 📈 Analytics & Monitoring

Consider adding:
- Google Analytics for PWA events
- Performance monitoring (Lighthouse CI)
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- User engagement metrics

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Push notifications for scan results
- [ ] Background sync for diagnoses
- [ ] Share API integration
- [ ] Badge API for unread notifications
- [ ] Periodic background sync
- [ ] Advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Offline queue for failed requests
